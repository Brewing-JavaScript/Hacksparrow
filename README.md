# InclusiveNews

A news and information platform designed to enhance accessibility for users with visual impairments or learning disabilities, providing tailored and verified content in an inclusive digital environment.

## ðŸ“– Project Overview

InclusiveNews transforms the way individuals with disabilities access news and information online. By integrating essential features like text-to-speech, customizable display settings, and fact-checking resources, it ensures that all usersâ€”regardless of their abilitiesâ€”can comfortably stay informed and verify the accuracy of content in real-time.

The platform prioritizes:
- **Accessibility:** Ensures usability for users with visual impairments through text-to-speech functionality and display customizations, including font size and color contrast.
- **Inclusivity:** Empowers users to access current events, educational materials, and various topics with ease.
- **Reliability:** Integrates fact-checking resources to combat misinformation and promote responsible information consumption.

## ðŸ§© Problem Solved

Many traditional websites overlook accessibility needs, leaving individuals with disabilities unable to access content comfortably or accurately. InclusiveNews bridges this gap by:
1. **Reducing accessibility barriers:** Offers intuitive, customizable display options and voice support for effortless content engagement.
2. **Promoting responsible content consumption:** Empowers users to verify news accuracy with built-in fact-checking mechanisms.
3. **Empowering all users:** Fosters a supportive environment for accessing trustworthy information on current events, education, and more.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Text-to-Speech:** Automatically reads articles aloud, enabling visually impaired users to navigate content hands-free.
- **Customizable Display:** Offers adjustable font size, color contrast, and other display settings to fit individual needs.
- **Fact-Checking Integration:** Verifies news credibility in real-time, equipping users to navigate misinformation confidently.
- **Content Summarization:** Summarizes lengthy articles without losing essential information, making content quick and easy to understand.

## ðŸ”¥ Challenges Faced and Solutions

### 1. Fact-Checking Integration
Integrating fact-checking resources presented significant challenges, as reliable real-time verification required automation. We addressed this by implementing a machine learning model for fact-checking, reducing manual input and ensuring timely accuracy.

### 2. Limited API Access
API key limitations due to budget constraints hindered access to essential services. By optimizing API usage with caching mechanisms and alternative methods, we maximized functionality while working within limited resources.

### 3. Text-to-Speech Automation
Creating seamless text-to-speech automation posed technical complexities, especially for visually impaired users. After thorough research and experimentation, we implemented a reliable text-to-speech solution that met the platform's accessibility standards.

### 4. Content Summarization
Ensuring concise yet informative content summarization required careful NLP tuning. We employed various natural language processing techniques and relied on user feedback to refine the summarization process for optimal relevance and accuracy.
